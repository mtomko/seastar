## Graph interpretation

Each cirle in the graph represents an assembled contig; the area of each
circle is proportional to the length of the contig sequence. The color 
indicats GC richness. Each black arrow represents the connection between
two mate pairs; the thickness of the black arrows represents the "bitscore".
Red arrows are "added dependencies to produce a fully ordered layout for 
SCAFF".
